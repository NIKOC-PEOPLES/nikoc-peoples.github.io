SHORT WEEK
--
This week my team and I focused on creating threshold for the Ai and how it will read.
--
We cultivated new ideas of how we want the Ai to read and what language will be used in the dialouge. We did extensive research on other analysts, broadcaster and sport spokesperson to generate ideas and vennacular that could benefit the understanding of what our model will be.
