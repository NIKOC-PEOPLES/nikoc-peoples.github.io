## About My Project

Sport Brief AI Solutions: 
Developing Post-game content using AI for automated box scores and video news reports

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Multi-Media experitse 
  - Implementing basketball / sport knowledge terms and overall assistance

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to utilize the dataset created by radio personality J. R. Jackson of JR SportBrief Productions and develop standalone AI news reports from selected sports events. Ideally, the report would automatically generate upon the completion of a specified sporting event, using the words and images currently found in the JR SportsBrief database.
